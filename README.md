# Comprehensive Analysis of Breast Cancer Treatment Time Prediction using Support Vector Machine

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of predicting treatment time for breast cancer patients, focusing on socioeconomic and geographic factors. Leveraging Support Vector Machine (SVM) modeling, the study explores various aspects of data preprocessing, visualization, modeling, and derives insights into the factors influencing treatment duration.

## Tools
- Excel: Utilized for initial data exploration and basic analysis.
- Python: Main programming language for data preprocessing, modeling, and analysis.
- Power BI: Employed for advanced data visualization and dashboard creation, facilitating interactive exploration of results.

## Data Preprocessing
- Conducted thorough data cleaning to ensure data quality and consistency.
- Imputed missing values, transformed features, and encoded categorical variables.
- Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation.

## Data Visualization
- Created interactive dashboards and visualizations using Power BI.
- Generated plots and charts to explore relationships between variables and identify trends.
- Enhanced data visualization with Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for in-depth analysis.

## Data Modeling
- Implemented Support Vector Machine (SVM) models for treatment time prediction.
- Optimized model hyperparameters using GridSearchCV for improved performance.
- Developed pipelines for streamlined integration of preprocessing and modeling tasks.
